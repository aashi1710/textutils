# TextUtils

"TextUtils" is a versatile text manipulation project that offers a range of useful features for handling text input. Users can input text into the TextUtils tool, and it provides several functions to manipulate and analyze the text, such as:

Text Removal: TextUtils allows you to easily remove all the text from the input, effectively wiping the content clean.

Case Conversion: You can change the case of the text, converting it to either all uppercase or all lowercase, depending on your preference.

Word Count: TextUtils provides a word count feature, helping you quickly determine the number of words in the input text.

Reading Time Estimation: The tool calculates an estimated reading time for the given text, making it useful for bloggers, authors, or anyone looking to gauge how long it might take to read a piece of text.

Text Preview: TextUtils generates a concise preview of the input text, allowing you to get a quick glimpse of the content.
